In 2013 I spent a total of $4035.00 on auto transportation which includes services from:

- on demand car services (uber, car2go, zipcar)
- car rentals (thrifty, avis)

this breaks down to $336.25 a month.

According to USA Today:

The average owner of a sedan has to shell out nearly $10,000 a year to own and operate that car, according to auto club AAA. A new AAA reports shows, on average, the cost of driving 15,000 miles a year rose 1.17 cents to 60.8 cents per mile, or $9,122 per year.

so at 10k a year, that is about $833.33 a month.

I don't have to worry about:
- parking
- parking tickets
- putting gas in the cars
- insurance
- break ins

In addition to paying 2.5x less, I get much more convenience and more options.

## The code:
To sum all numbers in the files use this perl one liner in a terminal.

`cat *.txt | perl -nle '$sum += $_ } END { print $sum'`
